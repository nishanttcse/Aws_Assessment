# AWS Free Tier Assessment — Terraform Solutions

This repository contains Terraform templates, scripts, and documentation to complete the five tasks requested:
1. Networking & Subnetting (VPC)
2. EC2 Static Website Hosting (Nginx)
3. High Availability + Auto Scaling (ALB + ASG)
4. Billing & Free Tier Cost Monitoring (CloudWatch Alarm / Budget)
5. Architecture Diagram (PNG)

**Important:** I cannot access or create resources in your AWS account. This repository provides working Terraform code, user-data scripts, draw.io-compatible architecture diagram (PNG), and step-by-step instructions so you can run everything in your own AWS Free Tier account, capture screenshots required for submission, and then destroy the resources.

See each folder for per-task README, Terraform files, and scripts.
